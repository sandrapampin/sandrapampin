  <summary>💡<b> More about me </b> </summary>

My career has followed two paths that, while different, have always been connected: marketing and analytics. For years, I developed strategies for industrial and retail companies, managing communication projects and lead generation campaigns—always with a data-driven and results-oriented approach.

Over time, I realized my interest went beyond just creating strategies; I wanted to take a more data-driven approach, where decisions are based on insights rather than intuition. That led me to dive into a Data Analytics Bootcamp and specialized courses, learning SQL, ETL processes, Power Query, data modeling, DAX, Python, and dashboard creation in Power BI. To solidify these skills, I’ve been working on small projects, applying my knowledge and refining best practices in real-world scenarios.

Driven by both curiosity and passion, I want to continue growing in Data Analytics and create value through the strategic use of data. My goal is to work on projects where information plays a key role in improving processes and driving impact.
